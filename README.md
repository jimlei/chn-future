# CHN Future
En samling tanker og ideer for videre drift av Club Honda Norge. Merk at dette bare er mine meninger, de kan være riv ruskende gale.

## Hvorfor være medlem?
Et problem har vært å få satt opp et tilbud som hvermansen finner interessant. 

Tidligere har CHN blitt drevet mye "av entusiaster - for entusiaster", men sannheten er at det er få som er interesserte i å betale hundrevis av kroner i året for å være medlem i en klubb som bruker pengene på banetreff.

CHN trenger en klar og tydelig liste på hvorfor "Ola Nordmann" på 20, 30 eller 60, skal melde seg inn i klubben. Rabattavtaler er selvfølgelig ett moment, men andre ting kan jo også frontes. Eksempelvis blader abbonnement man på tjenester kan legge ved, kunnskapsportal på nett, gratis kjøp og salg med andre Hondaeiere, treffkvelder med mulighet for skruhjelp, fotokurs, bilpleiekurs, etc etc.

## Medlemshåndtering
Her ville jeg bare gitt opp å forsøke å drive selv og fått på plass en profesjonell løsning så snart som mulig. Er det mulig å sette sånt ut av Norge? En fordel her, om man skal ha en nettportal, er om medlemsløsningen støtter å "prate med" nettportalløsningen.

## Tilværelsen på nett & Facebook
Facebooksiden bør bygges om til en vanlig firmaside, der det er mulig å kommentere "på siden". Hovedinnholdet bør være offisielle nyheter fra CHN.

### club-honda.org
Bør bygges om til en moderne enkeltside med med svært bra bilder, informasjon om klubben og framtrendende innmeldingsinformasjon (og -knapp). Siden burde også ha innholdsblokker for klubbens aktiviteter, som eks landstreff - som bør lenke videre til-

### club-honda.org/acr *(eller våler, rudskogen, nurburgring)*
Bør settes opp på samme lest som over. En moderne enkeltside med svært bra bilder, informasjon om treff, informasjon og knapp til påmelding, mm.

### club-honda.org/forum
Utgår.

## Samarbeide
Brevet under ser jeg for meg (som et utkast til) å sende til hondaklubbene i sverige, danmark og island.

#### Invitation to a case study for Club Honda Scandinavia
*This is just a draft of what we are thinking. In no way should this be considered final, this is intended only to give a starting foundation for discussions*

The last few years there has been a trend for communities to dwindle and die because of lack of activity. We've seen a number of Norwegian car clubs shut down, and we do not want the Honda entusiast clubs to suffer the same fate. As we too see the effects of decreasing activity we invite the Honda clubs of scandinavia to a case study where we explore our possibilities.

##### Our vision

The Honda clubs of Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden merge to form "Club Honda Scandinavia".

We are thinking that the different countries have their own modern, single page landing page with information about the community, what benefits you get from joining, etc. In addition it could make sense to have similar single pages to present club activities, ie a page about track days, a page about a big track day / meet, etc.

These landing pages then link to the same online community.

If we merge all our forums we would have close to 2 million posts and more than 20.000 users! We will also have at least 3 times more people willing to step up as article writers, forum moderators, webmasters, etc. We are sure more content, users and activity will engage growth and bring in new users and get the ball rolling again.

A forum merge will also bring other benefits.

With Scandinavia joined we will have a user base with tremendous knowledge. Bringing these together can help in generating even more interesting and good quality discussions and content. Also the joint knowledge will help with any questions that both new and existing users might have.

One popular feature of our community is the possibility to buy and sell cars, parts and other items to other Honda owners. With multiple countries represented we would have a more complete market with buyers and sellers with varied interests and requirements.

The norwegian club has had their own member magazine before (Double Wishbone), a project we would love to get going again. Perhaps there would be interest to put together a Club Honda Scandinavia magazine..?

We are also very excited about the possibility to have more, or larger international track days and meets.

##### Administration
A board collected from the different nations will be selected to have responsibility to manage the upper level of the club. In reality we would rely on the members to initiate contact, meetings and other activities across borders. It would also be a continuous community effort to decide when to change or scale technical solutions.

##### Technical solution

###### Landing pages
Either a selection of members, a design firm or a cheap online template can be tailored to fit as a base for country spesific landing pages.

The discussion forums can be set up to run on a virtual server, ie in the Netherlands through Digital Ocean. The advantage of running at a cloud service is that we can easily upgrade the server(s) without any downtime as we see the need for it. We think we budget generously when we add $1/member for server costs. This will also cover a smaller plan VPS for the landing pages.

Using a modern forum solution like Invision Power Board 4 would give both users and admins an excellent experience. Without fully committing to that forum solution we see it as the most interesting because of its quality, community, modern look, feel and features, and the possibility to migrate other forum solutions to IPB.

IPB also sports a native shopping solution where we can sell both memberships and club effects. Our experience have shown that it's preferred to have a professional solution for both the web shop and member registration/support. We would like to integrate with a company that delivers member registration/print member cards and have a webshop that tells our site/forum when a user has made a successful payment. A solution like this would of course add more cost for each member, but we think it's worth it to give the best possible experience.

The yearly membership cost seems to be around $35 to $50. We think it would be natural to agree on having one price for all countries.

Membership: $50
Paypal fee: $1.75
Server cost: $1
Local club gets $48.25

###### What's next?
Please get back to us as soon as possible, wa want to know if this is interesting or not.

Let's work together to form the best car community possible!

Club Honda Norway
